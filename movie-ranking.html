<h1>XCEL'S ANIME RECOMMENDATION</h1>

<h2>My Top Animes of all Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>

<P>
Best scripted; Gradual intoduction of their big guns<br />
It is also very cultured and well-presented.<br />
</P>

<h3>Jijutsu Kaisen</h3>

<P>
Great action; Real show of power and scorery<br />
Run away from this movie if you aren't a fan of mass destruction.<br />
</P>

<h3>Classroom of the Elite</h3>

<P>
Real show of intelligence; A show of action, thriller, and show-biz suspense all in one anime<br />
If you like this one, then your IQ is way higher than you actually rate it.<br />
</P>

<h3>Promise Neverland</h3> 

<P>
Great thriller series with loads of twists and suspense<br />
Leave this one if you get easily irriated when children are hurt.<br />
</P>

<h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3>

<P>
This series never gets old. The writer had the intention of giving the viewer something for their whole family<br />
